PipTheme by Pipfrosch Press
===========================

This is a fork of the Simome WordPress theme intended to meet the needs of
Pipfrosch Press.

Specifically it enhances privacy by removing third party resources the Simone
theme referenced (such as Google Fonts) and by disabling some of the third
party references that WordPress adds by default.

Note that this does not guarantee no trackers, for example a plugin in use
might add a third party resource that tracks or Gravatar if enabled in your
WordPress site will add a third party resource.

Some CSS and other tweeks have also been made, see the CHANGELOG.md file.
